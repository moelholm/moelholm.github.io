This Saturday I ran `Brooks O.U.T.81 - 2025` (Outdoor Ultra Trail 81 kilometers) - an ultra trail race that goes through the heart of Jutland, Denmark.

It is a point-to-point race that takes you through some of Denmark's most diverse and beautiful landscapes. It starts way out on Harrild Hede (the heath) and finishes at Velling Koller in the hilly, forested area near Bryrup.

This was my second time running it - I ran the slightly longer 101k distance back in 2023 (in 11h58m). That was my first 100k run. But it was also the race that took out my knee for ~3 months (ish, IIRC). Rather early in the race I strained something and then I obviously chose to push through 🙊 (not recommended 😇 - don't do this. Instead: Take the DNF and keep the training consistency!). But the 2023 race itself was nevertheless wonderful and the experience stayed with me. So this year I was ready at the start line again. Last year I would also have been, if it hadn't been for the UTMB CCC race taking top priority 😉.

### Pre-Race 📋

I was up early 04 something something. Then drove my car to the finish line. There I collected the race bib and jumped into a bus that drove us to the starting line. Idea being: "follow the flags to get back to your car 😂".

### Race Experience 🌟

We started on the open, quiet Harrild Hede where there's "sky high and heather along the track".

The route constantly changed terrain and surfaces. From the desolate heath, the course winds through deep forests before reaching the intense, hilly finale in the forested Velling area.

The 81k route covered 1361m of elevation gain according to my Garmin watch - a very challenging course! The thing is ... these vertical meters were not evently spread over the entire route, but rather on a some good concentrated parts. Therefore, once we did face them, then they could really be felt. There were even a few places where I had to use my arms/hands to scramble up some steep ascents 🐐. It always amazes me when Danish races can offer vertical like this 👍🏻

The effort I put in combined with the heat and the - at times - tough terrain caused me to have many near-cramp warnings in my legs. I also had some very mild ones. Calves, inner thighs, front of lower leg - you name it. Luckily I managed to dodge fullblown cramping by putting in a bit less effort 😇 when needed.  But it was a balancing act 😂

The end had a fun finish "detail": we entered the finish area at around 70k. However, then we had to head out for 2 loops of ~5k each. These loops where actually quite "fair" (no insane elevation) and a nice way to finish the long day out. However there were 2 small issues with the loop; a nasty mud section (that got me twice!!🤨) and a tree trunk I had to crawl under ... imagine that with extremely tired/exhausted/stiff legs (to be clear: that's cramping just waiting to happen) 🤣

After 8h53m05s out there (avg pace ~6:34 min/km) I finished as number 5 out of 39 finishers (plus a handful of DNFs). I grabbed a much-needed protein bar and a delicious Coca Cola 🤤

I am so proud of this achievement. But there is another thing I also found pretty intense: late race (50k+) I was told several times that I was running for 3rd position 🤯. It was pretty stressful in a cool way 😅. After 67k or so that changed and I was passed by one runner (much stronger end-race than me) and then another one 5k or so after that. But still ... I was almost running for podium is this amazing field of hardcore ultra runners 😎.

### Recommended?

Absolutely! 

The race description promised "equal parts experience, challenges and magnificent nature" with "changing routes, a contrasting journey and a finale that becomes hard, intense and festive." It definitely delivered on that promise! 

The race organization by Eventyrsport was professional as always, with well-stocked aid stations along the route and a happy and smiling crew. The finish area at Velling Koller was really idyllic. And the wooden medal plus the post-race goodies were spot on!

This race is one of my favorites on the Danish ultra calendar. If you're looking for an outstanding Danish ultra trail experience that showcases the country's diverse landscapes, O.U.T. is hard to beat. I will for sure be coming back for another edition! 🇩🇰

This race gets my rare (...ahem ... 🤣) 5-star rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
