A week ago I ran `LNBK Ringk√∏bing Fjord Winter Edition 2025` - a 100 kilometer race around Ringk√∏bing Fjord in Denmark.

This is how it looked like on Strava after my race:

We were super lucky with the weather: it was sunny but chilly - and almost windstill. The first 50 kilometers down the fjord was practically windstill. The next 50 kilometers, however, up the fjord (back again to Ringk√∏bing) was windy. The typical west wind near Denmarks west coast. 

I started out harder than I planned for, because I kept up with the leading group of runners (well we were leading the race except from a single runner that was way in front of us quickly). That also meant that my first half was faster than my second half (a positive split). In fact this race was generally so fast for me that I set a:

- Second fastest Marathon PB in the time `3h34m14s`
- 50K PB in the time `4h19m20s`
- 100K PB in the time `9h56m41s`

I determined the 100K PB afterwards on Strava using the analysis tools there. It is the first time that I have had a sub-10h race. This is of course super cool - but another explanation is also that most of my 100K+ races are trail races (/mountain trail races), which you don't tend to set PBs with.

Besides all this "PB" focus: I also actually had a very great day. The good weather had its share of that - but then also the scenery you run through over those 100K is just really beautiful. Rough at times - but beautiful. The race director and the volunteers did a fantastic job and it was a pleasure to get to each of the aid stations. 

Had a blast out there. I don't think this was the last time I showed up at the starting line for this race üëçüèª
