Yesterday I completed the `Brooks O.U.T. - Outdoor Ultra Trail 2025` - the {{ page.distance_km }} kilometer distance through the heart of Jutland, Denmark.

O.U.T. (Outdoor Ultra Trail) is a point-to-point ultra trail race that takes you through some of Denmark's most diverse and beautiful landscapes. The 81k distance starts way out on Harrild Hede (the heath) and finishes at Velling Koller in the hilly, forested area near Bryrup.

The race description promised "equal parts experience, challenges and magnificent nature" with "changing routes, a contrasting journey and a finale that becomes hard, intense and festive." They definitely delivered on that promise! 

### Pre-Race üìã

The morning started early with bib collection and prep at the starting area. The atmosphere was relaxed but focused, with the small field of 81k runners knowing we had a long day ahead of us.

### The Course üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Starting on the open, quiet Harrild Hede where there's "sky high and heather along the track," the route constantly changes terrain and surfaces. From the desolate heath, the course winds through deep forests before reaching the intense, hilly finale in the forested Velling area.

The 81k route covered 81.4km according to my Garmin with 1,361m of elevation gain - a proper challenging course that kept changing character throughout the day. The variety of terrain made it engaging mentally, even when the legs were getting tired in the later stages.

### Race Day Experience üåü

With only 39 finishers on the 81k distance, this felt like a properly challenging ultra. Finishing 5th overall with a time of 8h53m05s was a solid result that I'm happy with. The pace worked out to 6:34 min/km average - not bad for such a technical and varied course!

The race organization by Eventyrsport was professional as always, with well-stocked aid stations along the route and that promised "happy and smiling crew" - which they absolutely had! The finish area at Velling Koller was indeed festive, and getting a medal plus the post-race meal hit the spot after nearly 9 hours out there.

### Mid-Race Highlights üì∏

Some more shots from different parts of the course - the changing terrain and beautiful Danish countryside really made this race special:

### Thoughts üí≠

This was my second time doing O.U.T. - I ran the 101k distance back in 2023 (in 11h 58m). The 81k felt like the perfect distance for this course - long enough to be a proper challenge but allowing you to really push and race rather than just survive.

The point-to-point nature means you really get that sense of journey, traveling through Denmark's diverse landscapes from the open heath to deep forests to rolling hills. It's a race that showcases what Danish trail running can offer - maybe not the dramatic mountain vistas of the Alps, but beautiful in its own unique way.

### Post-Race üèÖ

After nearly 9 hours on the trail, crossing the finish line felt incredible! The medal ceremony and post-race festivities were a great way to celebrate with fellow runners who had also completed the challenging journey.

### Recommended?

Absolutely! This race has quickly become one of my favorites on the Danish ultra calendar. The course variety keeps you engaged mentally throughout the day, the organization is top-notch, and the challenge level is just right for the 81k distance. If you're looking for a proper Danish ultra trail experience that showcases the country's diverse landscapes, O.U.T. is hard to beat. Looking forward to potentially coming back for another edition! üá©üá∞
