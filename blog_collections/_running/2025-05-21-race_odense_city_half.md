This weekend I just ran a half marathon in Odense, Denmark üá©üá∞: Odense City Half.

The route starts and ends in the city park "Munke Mose" and is essentially a loop format where you run 4 x 5K. The first loop, however, has a little extra part to it (to get the extra 1.1K in).

I was there early (I always am at races) and I positioned myself near the front runners. Just behind the 1:30 pacers.

The first 10K went well. The first 3K a bit too fast though; `3:57`, `4:01`, `4:04`. But I felt great and not like I was running above my limits. I then settled into a pace near `4:10` which is what I really was aiming at. My objective was not to go all out - it was to run comfortably strong (hard effort, but controlled). I think I did that in the first part at least. But then during the 3rd loop I started to loose power: my pace naturally dropped. That surprised me üòÇ. Normally it happens as a result of a noticeable hard effort - but not this time though.

My heart rate was rather stable at an average of `131` bpm (red graph). My cadence was also pretty stable at around `182` (purple). As was my perceived effort (worked, but felt OK). At the end of the last loop however there was one noticeable sign; my right calf was almost about to cramp. So from that point on I held back a bit to not trigger the cramp. Speculation: There could be multiple causes (perhaps ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) ... It was rather warm, there was some noticeable head wind at selected segments, ... and it was only a week ago that I ran the 42K SkyTrail race (and perhaps I was only superficially recovered). 

That aside I did attempt to minimize the "damage" by staying calm and focused. And I think it still ended really well; A `1:31:00` official time producing a `47 of 577` finisher result can only make me proud. In terms of Strava PBs it also went well; a "3rd PB" half marathon time of `1:29:46` (still makes me happy even though it wasn't the offical time üòÇ) but also 3 x "2nd PBs" for the `10K`, `15K` and `10M` distances.

I am happy I didn't crash fully and dropped several minutes. Sometimes you apparently just have to adapt. And I am happy for having run this wonderful race with a very cheering crowd on all parts of the route (it really helped to keep up the spirit). 

The best thing was that my family came to cheer for me. I will obviously not mention the part that I was too fast and so they missed me entirely. I will also not mention that I had to text them that I was at the finish-line hanging out üòÇ. Haha that was a first (turns out they have struggled to find a parking place ... since the city was pretty crowded due to the very same event here üòâ). But hey ... it was just lovely that they came afterwards so I could show off my lovely new shiny medal.

Yes!

The race route brings you through different areas; the park, some living areas and into the city pedistrian streets. It gives a very good and varied course. And the fact that it is a loop format - which you have to complete 4 times - can either be seen as a positive thing or a negative thing. It depends on _you_. For me it was OK. I must admit that it was a bit mentally hard to go into loop 3, knowing that it has to be completed together with yet another loop. But at least you know the entire course - no nasty surprises. All in all it worked fine for me.

The race organization was super professional. They have tried this before and were very geared to handle many runners (1300+ registered runners at least) and their supporters. Many toilets, quick check-in, a bag service (to keep your stuff for post-race), a nice finisher medal, a nice t-shirt.  

This race gets an almost top of the line 4-star rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
