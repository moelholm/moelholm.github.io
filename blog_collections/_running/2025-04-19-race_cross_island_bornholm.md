My family and I have been enjoying the Easter vacation on Bornholm this year. While being there my wife found out that the half marathon `Cross Island Bornholm 2025` was about to be held. She nudged me to run it - so that’s exactly what I did. Didn’t need much push 🤭😂.

The race was starting very close to our vacation home in Gudhjem in the east: at the art museum in Rø. Then the route went via paved roads and gravel roads crossing the Island (Bornholm) to the city in west, Rønne - at the stadium. This is how the route looked like on Strava after I ran it:

A few photos from the starting area at the art museum:

As the route has more descend than ascent I figured it would be “very fast”. So I aimed at trying to set a shiny new PB for the half marathon distance.

The route started with a quick descent and then the same ascent back up again. It was fun downhill - and equally tough uphill. I really tried to find the sweet spot effort wise on the way up. I think I did. Then the route transitioned a bit more into some minor undulating terrain until kilometer 11. From that point on it was almost exclusively downhill (and a little bit flat, super limited ascent. Almost zero). Quite amazing 🤩. From the same kilometer point we also faced some headwind. That honestly at times could be felt as a limiting factor. But sunny and warm it was 🤗🤠. And the headwind was definitely not a deal breaker … just annoying given the opportunity for a fast race.

My family waited for me at a few key spots along the route. They also - btw - send me from the starting line, and they also greeted and cheered for me at the finish line. That was super lovely. What a nice support 🥳🤩.

Fast forward to the end. I did not beat my PB (from 2024) but I did have an extraordinary run with a very satisfying effort. I could not deliver more under these circumstances. In fact my result was really fine I think; out of 234 finishers I ended up 10th 🤯🤗. Much better than I had dreamed about (such a big field considered). Additionally, my effort led to my 2nd best official lifetime half marathon result and a range of other related 2nd best lifetime PBs on Strava; 5K, 10K, 15K, 10M, 20K and Half marathon. So: 🥳.

In conclusion I felt I was running at the edge of what was possible for me at my current fitness level. I consciously speeded up and down at different segments to just about ride the redline. Granted; below it … but not much. I am also satisfied with my fueling and hydration approach too. Before the race I was fully hydrated and fueled with a portion of electrolytes sports drink. During the race; a gel after ~7K and another after ~15K … and a ~300ml Salomon water bottle (hand carried) emptied starting at 10K or so.

### Recommended?
100% yes! 

This race was super fast. And because it  has more descent (159 meters according to my Garmin watch) than ascent (117 meters, also according to my Garmin watch) it has a potential to break PBs. 

The route was very simple (mostly straight) and without sharp turns. Race volunteers at every road crossing and major turns. It also had a few aid stations with accommodating volunteers and spectators cheering for you. At certain segments it was quite scenic too; beautiful 🤩. Lastly, the finish line at the stadium in Rønne was quite epic. It definitely gave me goosebumps and an extra kick over the finish line 🤠.

This race gets an almost top of the line 4-star rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
