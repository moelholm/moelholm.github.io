I have just dusted off this Web site to make room for sharing my running journey too. I have been growing more and more fond of running over the last couple of years. So I hope I can find some time and energy to share my experiences (especially going forward) here. 

With it, I hope that I can inspire other people to see why running is so fantastic too. 

It is also a place for me to capture some notes about races etc (you know ... I'm getting old soon enough ... so when I forget about them, then I can hopefully refresh my memory by reading the notes ðŸ˜‚).
