Yesterday I ran `Eventyrsport VinterTrail Mols Bjerge 2025` - a {{ page.distance_km }} kilometer trail race in Mols Bjerge National Park.

The race is a 28K trail race that goes through a very undulating landscape, resulting in 883m EG according to my Garmin watch. So it was indeed a challenging course. But I knew that, because I ran the race a year ago. The race this year was a little bit shorter and had a little bit less EG. Like last year we primarily ran on exposed grassy hills, some forest sections and a little bit of beach at the end (very little). Almost all trails were super runnable. Quite fun to hammer the downhills 🤠 (more about that below...).

PurePower was one of the sponsors this year, so upon check-in (bib collection) we could grab 3 of their products: a gel, some chews, and a snack bar:

</div>

That was really nice: I didn't even bring any energy with me from home 👌🏼.

Normally I have plenty of capacity to take photos before, during and after the race. This time it only amounted to a handful - I was simply too busy "racing" out there on the course. But here are two of the few photos I did remember to take:

I aimed at running faster this year than last year. Technically I did finish faster this year, but the course was also slightly shorter and with less EG. And according to Strava my pace was slighly slower this year. But now comes the interesting part: I placed much better this year 🧐. Last year I finished 36th of 165 finishers - this year I placed 27th of 218 finishers. And I must admit ... I felt I ran really strong this year, so I was surprised to learn that my pace were slower. Slightly confused there 😂. But happy with my better position for sure.

Anyways ... back to the downhills (☝🏼remember?). They were super runnable ... so I gave it everything; ran as fast as I could downhill. I had the time of my life ... until I stumbled and fell. I slided several meters on my front / chest. Didn't hurt and didn't get any injuries. But OMG: I slided right into a Cow's 🐮 poop 💩. Not only into ... I took it with me on my chest and left shoulder and arm 🤣. It must have been quite a sight. Actually a runner behind me saw it and asked if I was ok (trail runners are always so compassionate and helpful). I told her "yes, no problems - I'm good". Which was true ... although a little bit annoyed and smelly (that poop was not super old...) 😆.

Haha yeah I will not forget about this race any time soon. Despite my fall I had a wonderful time. The race is one of my favorites here in Denmark: super organized and top runnable fantastic trails.
