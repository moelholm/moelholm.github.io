Updated my blog such that it for each race blog post now render links to:

\- the strava activity  
\- itra, utmb, duv race result lists (where such exist)

The screenshot shows an extreme example (mozart 100) that has them all ðŸ¤ 

Probably mostly fun for myself (as is the entire race notes post idea)â€¦ but it can theoretically give a little bit more race context to the reader (if they try to follow themâ€¦) ðŸ™‚
