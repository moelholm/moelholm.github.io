Did 2 x DHL Relay runs yesterday

5K loops. Had to cover for a colleague that was ill (in addition to my own run). Went well ðŸ˜Ž

Nasty hill in the beginning and at the end. Totally took all my power away (despite the otherwise wonderful downhills also).

First (official time: 20:09): [https://strava.app.link/B8PzlxVp2Vb](https://strava.app.link/B8PzlxVp2Vb)

Second (official time: 20:33): [https://strava.app.link/XT0SIyXp2Vb](https://strava.app.link/XT0SIyXp2Vb)
