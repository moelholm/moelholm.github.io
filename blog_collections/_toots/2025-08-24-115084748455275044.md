15K Morning Run and 10K Afternoon Run

As I started my PM run I had heavy tired legs. But after a kilometer or so I decided to force some turnover ‚Ä¶ and weirdly enough it was as if the ‚Äúsystem woke up‚Äù. There was a terrible headwind thoughüí® for the first ~5-6 ish kilometers. But still I felt I was pushing ok (without feeling like dying too). Felt great. But I need rest now. Next week‚Äôs volume will be decreasing üòá
