Welcome, I'm Nicky Moelholm and this is my personal web site. Here you find my blog containing
posts about super cool software development subjects.

##### About me

I live in Billund, Denmark, with my wonderful family. Teresa and our 3 children: Isabella, Noah and Casper.

##### My job

I currently work for LEGO System A/S as a Senior Application Engineer on the B2B eCommerce team.

On this team, I function as product architect, backend developer and to some degree also as an infrastructure
engineer. Needless to say, this is not a huge team. We are lucky to get to work with microservices hosted on AWS. And
we actively use FaaS and container based services in our daily work. And of course a bunch of other super interesting
technologies.
