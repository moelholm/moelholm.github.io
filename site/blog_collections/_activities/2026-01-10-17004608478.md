I think this was harder than last year 😅! First 50K section had annoying ice/snow segments that after a while tend to destroy the legs a bit. Then the usual last 50K (toughest) finished them off (the legs). 

But beautiful route as always. Raw west coast rolling hills are fantastic (and also hardcore to run on). Well done by the race organization and the volunteers 👏🏻🤩.
