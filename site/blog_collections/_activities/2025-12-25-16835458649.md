description: "I got these awesome new ASICS shoes as a gift here for Christmas - so I decided I would see if I could set a PB. TBH I almost stopped the mission at 5K … but then I recovered over the next kilometer and could keep up the pace for the remaining part 😀👏🏻. The last 4-5K almost felt better than the first 5K."
