description: "Result: 129 of 313 finishers (337 DNFs)

Thank you Sweden 🇸🇪 for this epic night race 😀! This was my second time running it; this time ~13K longer. Almost same EG. I had a good race well into the daylight. I felt great and could run. But then after ~100-115K ish my body wouldn’t run anymore: it became (unwillingly) a mix of hike and jogging. For the remainder of the race. So that’s where I “lost” a lot of time. Every kilometer was hard earned 😂.

We passed the finish area 2 times: after 120 kilometers and then for the finishline. At 120K I suspect many DNF’ed. The race organizers did this deliberately ofc - evil 😈 as they are. 

At around 4K before the end we came very close to the finish line… again … then only to head out for the last 4K 🤣. But I suspected this would happen - as it did last year. This year was a bit cooler though - they made a fancy loop with lights and music etc. Top theming for sure 👏🏻

Lucky with the weather. Until the last 20K where it started raining. And I can tell you there was a lot of mud on the mountain. It was seriously not funny to descent that. Happy I brought my running poles 👌🏻.

Bonus info: I saw hallucinations on day two. Rocks 🪨 and trees 🌳 basically only … but in my mind they became humans and other creatures 🙃🤠. So that’s what happens when I don’t go to bed per my usual schedule 😂

I was greeted by my lovely 🥰 family at the finish line, where Casper joined me to cross it ☺️. I got a shower and big pizza and fell asleep immediately.
