I am happy I participated 👌🏻. I ran it in 2023 as a 25K variant and recalled it was super nice. Indeed the route didn’t disappoint: very beautiful and fun to race 👌🏻🥳. Quite hilly and the loop 🔁 I ran 3 times turned more and more muddy. But it was still epic - highly recommended. I felt strong in the two first loops and even on/off in the third- was really great. But I was also stuffing lots of liquid carbs in 😎
