This is a summary of how 2025 turned out to be for me in terms of running. I have kept it very short when it comes to mentioning the races etc., otherwise it would be a neverending story 😉.

# Training Volume
According to Strava, in 2025 I ran `4850K` over `464h20m` with a total elevation gain landing on `36.5K`. That's equivalent to an average of `93K` / `8.9h` per week.

The volume is slightly less than 2024 (5000K / 501h) - primarily due to Tuesday cross training in the first half of the year (stair stepper, prep for Mozart).
