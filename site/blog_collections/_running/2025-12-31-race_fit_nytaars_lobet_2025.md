This year I last-minute decided to run a New Year's Eve trail run - my last race of 2025 in my own backyard! It was right here in Billund where I live. In Frederikshåb Plantage (5 minutes by car from me) on some of the same usual trails that I frequently run on 🤠👌🏻

I actually ran this in 2023 with my buddy Bo. This year I had to do it alone though as he was somewhere in Austria skiing 😂.

I finished second place and am very happy with that! The race format was 3 loops of 7K each. I ran together with the winner for several kilometers - we had really nice chats along the way. In the end, I couldn't keep up and lost 1-2 minutes in the final stretch. The winner was definitely stronger 😅👏🏻. Still, it was an excellent experience on trails that I know and love.

### Recommended?

Yes indeed - this race is lovely. Small crowd. And the trails are wonderful - and I don't just say that because they are local - they truly are world-class 😎👌🏻. The course features awesome single track trails, gravel roads, and a bit of sand. It's on level with other super nice trails you find in other popular Danish trail races. 

The race is also super cheap. And you get a fine finisher medal as well as a piece of New Year's Eve cake 🤩👌🏻.

It gets my almost top of the line rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
