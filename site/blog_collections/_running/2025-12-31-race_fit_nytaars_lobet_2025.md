This year I last-minute decided to run a New Year's Eve trail run. It was right here in Billund where I live. In Frederikshåb Plantage (5 minutes by car from me) on some of the same usual trails that I frequently run on 🤠👌🏻

I actually ran this in 2023 with my buddy Bo. This year I had to do it alone though as he was somewhere in Austria skiing 😂.

### Recommended?

Yes indeed - this race is lovely. Small crowd. And the trails are wonderful - and I don't just say that because they are local - they are on level with other super nice trails you find in other popular Danish trail races. 

The race is also super cheap. And you get a fine finisher medal as well as a piece of New Year's Eve cake 🤩👌🏻.

It gets my almost top of the line rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
