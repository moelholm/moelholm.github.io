This is a summary of how 2025 turned out to be for me in terms of running 🏃‍♂️. I have kept it very short when it comes to mentioning the races etc., otherwise it would be a neverending story 😉.

# Training Volume
According to Strava, in 2025 I ran `4934K` over `471h23m` with a total elevation gain landing on `36730m`. That's equivalent to an average of `95K` / `9.1h` per week.

The volume is slightly less than 2024 (`5000K` / `501h`) - primarily due to Tuesday cross training in the first half of the year (stair stepper, prep for Mozart). I think this cross training (and added strength training in the first half of the year in particular) was well invested. I had an incredible Mozart 100 race: felt super strong compared to my UTMB CCC experience in 2024. Much stronger hiking and less critical performance drop.

This year was also the first where I had monthly running volumes exceeding `500K`: October with `~550K` and December with an all-time record of `~585K` 🥳🤩👏🏻

# Races

In 2025, I completed `17 races` totaling `1077K` with `18702m` of elevation gain over `132h` of racing. The races were split between `6 ultras` (≥50km) and `11 non-ultras`, as well as `10 trail races` and `7 road races`.

Highlights include my longest race ever: [Kullamannen 172.7K](/blog/running/2025/11/18/kullamannen_by_utmb_2025) with `26h41m` on feet. I also achieved a backyard ultra PB of `20 yards` (`134K`) at [Wayout Backyard Ultra](/blog/running/2025/04/01/race_wayout_backyard_ultra), finishing 13th of 163 starters.

# Half's
This year I pursued the sub-`90` minute half marathon goal across three races. The results were bittersweet - while my Strava times consistently showed sub-`90` performances, the official chip times were all just above the mark. Close, but not quite there! Here are the three attempts:

- [Race: Cross Island Bornholm](/blog/running/2025/04/19/race_cross_island_bornholm) - Official: `1h30m10s`, Strava half: `1h29m39s` 😆
- [Race: Odense City Half](/blog/running/2025/05/21/race_odense_city_half) - Official: `1h31m`, Strava half: `1h29m46s` 😭
- [Race: Bestseller Aarhus City Half](/blog/running/2025/06/27/race_bestseller_aarhus_city_half) - Official: `1h30m37s`, Strava half: `1h29m50s`

I'm really happy with these results even though I didn't manage to set a PB for the half. I feel much faster overall than in 2024 - but still wasn't able to beat my own 2024 PB 🤭. I'm sure I couldn't crank out ~`90` min half's like this back then - but apparently I had an epic race day in 2024 (at Bestseller Aarhus City Half) that is hard for me to beat still 🤔.

# ITRA Stats
During the year I reached ITRA Advanced 4 level 🏔️ - a milestone that reflects the accumulation of ultra distance races and vertical gain.

The journey to this level has taken me through adventures in Austria (Mozart 100), Sweden (Österlen Spring Trail and Kullamannen), and various trail races in Denmark. Below you see further race stats and a screenshot of the ITRA 'legend' table describing the point ranges that apply to each level.

My highest race score this year was `578` (see last screenshot).

# UTMB Stats
I'm now in the top `9%` of UTMB runners worldwide 🌍 with an index of `546`. My highest race score this year was `561`.

I suspect it will be very difficult to keep improving these indices over the next years. It would be a dream of course - but "just" getting into the `600` range requires a fitness level I'm nowhere near now.

# Personal Bests

This year brought a number of new personal bests across various distances. Below is a summary of the key achievements organized by distance.

Ultra distances

| Distance | Pace | Time | Context |
|----------|------|------|---------|
| 100M (`160K`) | `06:49 /km` | `18h11m` | [Race: Mors 100 Miles](/blog/running/2025/09/06/race_mors_100_miles) |
| 100K | `06:00 /km` | `10h18m29s` | [Race: LNBK Ringkøbing Fjord Winter Edition](/blog/running/2025/01/19/race_ringkobingfjord) |
| 50K | `05:11 /km` | `4h19m20s` | [Race: LNBK Ringkøbing Fjord Winter Edition](/blog/running/2025/01/19/race_ringkobingfjord) |

I'm really proud of especially the 100 miler in the `18h` range ⚡.

Medium distances

| Distance | Pace | Time | Context |
|----------|------|------|---------|
| 30K | `04:30 /km` | `2h15m` | Training |
| 10K | `03:59 /km` | `39m50s` | Training |
| 5K | `03:54 /km` | `19m29s` | Training: 5K time trial |

The `5K` in sub-20 minutes is a milestone I'm proud of 🎯. And the `10K` in sub-40 minutes (although stars aligned for this to happen: little wind, carbon plate shoes 👌🏻 (Christmas gift 🥳😂) and a fast route with a tiny net decline).

Short distances

| Distance | Pace | Time | Context |
|----------|------|------|---------|
| 1K | `03:38 /km` | `3m38s` | Race: DHL Stafetten |
| 1/2 mile | `03:30 /km` | `2m49s` | Training: Ridaos Intervals |
| 400m | `03:20 /km` | `1m20s` | Training: Ridaos Intervals |
