This is a summary of how 2025 turned out to be for me in terms of running. I have kept it very short when it comes to mentioning the races etc., otherwise it would be a neverending story 😉.

# Training Volume
According to Strava, in 2025 I ran `4850K` over `464h20m` with a total elevation gain landing on `36.5K`. That's equivalent to an average of `93K` / `8.9h` per week.

The volume is slightly less than 2024 (5000K / 501h) - primarily due to Tuesday cross training in the first half of the year (stair stepper, prep for Mozart).

# Achievements

## Half Marathon Attempts
This year I chased the sub-90 minute half marathon goal across three races. The results were bittersweet - while my Strava times consistently showed sub-90 performances, the official chip times were all just above the mark. Close, but not quite there! Here are the three attempts:

- [Race: Cross Island Bornholm](/blog/running/2025/04/19/race_cross_island_bornholm) - Official: 1h30m10s, Strava half: 1h29m39s 😆
- [Race: Odense City Half](/blog/running/2025/05/21/race_odense_city_half) - Official: 1h31m, Strava half: 1h29m46s 😭
- [Race: Bestseller Aarhus City Half](/blog/running/2025/06/27/race_bestseller_aarhus_city_half) - Official: 1h30m37s, Strava half: 1h29m50s

## ITRA Runner Index
During the year I reached ITRA Advanced 4 level - a milestone that reflects the accumulation of ultra distance races and vertical gain. The journey to this level has taken me through some fantastic trails and mountains across Europe.
