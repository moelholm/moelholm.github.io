Back again for another lap around Ringkøbing Fjord! This year I ran the `LNBK Ringkøbing Fjord Winter Edition 2026` - a {{ page.distance_km }} kilometer race around the beautiful fjord on Denmark's west coast.

By the way: I was up early at 03:40 to make sure I could get to race check-in and everything starting at 06:30 in Ringkøbing. Worth it though 🌅💪🏻!

### Comparison to 2025

I ran this race [last year as well](https://moelholm.com/blog/running/2025/01/19/race_ringkobingfjord) - so I have something to compare to! That was a great experience with perfect weather and some nice PBs. This year turned out quite different though 😅.

The first 50K section was significantly more technical and harder to run this time around - lots of snow and ice on the paths that really hammered the legs. You have to constantly adjust your stride and landing, which takes a toll after a while. The last 50K was roughly on par with last year in terms of difficulty, but I suspect my legs were already pretty "shut down" from the tough first half 😬.

I also had a rather nasty bonk in the final 15K or so. Turns out my bottle caps had frozen solid and I couldn't drink anything 🥶! I think that definitely contributed to hitting the wall harder than usual towards the end of the race.

### Recommended?

Absolutely! Despite the tough conditions this year, it's still a beautiful and well-organized race 👌🏻. The raw west coast rolling hills and the route around the fjord are fantastic - harsh at times, but that's part of the charm. The race organization and volunteers did an excellent job as always 👏🏻🤩.

One small note though: access to a toilet during the race would have been nice 😅.

But yeah - you should definitely give this race a go if you're looking for a proper winter 100K challenge in Denmark! I'll be back 🤠👍🏻.
