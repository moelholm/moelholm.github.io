This was a special race to me as I consider it the race that started my running obsession back in 2022. Back then I entered for the 7K distance with 455m EG. One loop up, down and around Himmelbjerget. I was so motivated from that race that I continued with longer and longer distances since then. It is essentially why I am an ultra runner today. 

Fast forward to this year - 2025 - I now signed up to the longest distance: the 42K race (6 loops). These 42K are no ordinary kilometers - they include a staggering 2730m EG according to the race organization 🤯. In little Denmark 🇩🇰 🤯. It’s an average 6% grade; same as for my UTMB CCC race in 2024! Very impressive race in Denmark - rightfully - I think - deserving its SkyTrail title.

My strategy was; hold back effort until the last 1 or 2 loops and then let go. And I did that; constantly reminding myself to be careful on the effort spent on uphill and downhill in particular. Not hammering downhills. Not over power hiking uphill. Just good moderate efforts. On the very few flat segments I turned on the turbo though - since the impact was minimal for doing so.

And even though I held back effort (/pace) due to the length of the race I actually ran the first 2 loops this year faster than I did the first year I ran it. In 2022 it took me `55:17`. This year I had the following loop times: `52:14`, `52:39`, `59:51`, `01:06:00`, `01:09:52`, `01:06:02`. In 2022 I was totally exhausted after this 1 loop. This year as I entered loop 3 I was still “fresh”.

But then on loop 4 I started having cramp threats. The massive downhill running started to catch up with me. And likely the undulating uphills too. The threats made me drop effort immediately; I simply couldn’t dare having full blown quad cramps. Especially not running down steep trails. So that’s why my times dropped instantly from loop 4 and onwards. My muscular endurance was spent. Kaputski. But by managing the effort wisely I kept on moving at an ok effort level. I just couldn’t push faster anymore. I tried at the last loop which is where I gambled a bit … thinking “it’s over soon, just let go” … so you can see that I ran it almost 4 minutes faster than on loop 5.

The weather was awesome so we were super lucky. And with one of Denmarks absolute finest routes (and probably toughest too) I couldn’t have dreamed of a better day. 

As I ran into the finish line I was cheered at 🤩 by my good colleague Nicolae Cernean and his fiancé e Iana. That was so nice - so I did my best to look like it was an easy run 😆😂. Btw they both kicked absolute a**; Nico on his 14k (2 loops) and Iana with her 7K (1 loop) 👏🏻👏🏻.

### Recommended?
100% yes!

Sounds like a broken record by now I’m sure (if you’ve read some of the other race reports). Well to be fair … I’ve had zero races I regret. 

But in this case; you cannot find a tougher race in Denmark 🇩🇰 with regard to the Elevation Gain you are exposed to. It competes with or even exceeds some races in the alps etc. Truly a unique race in Denmark. But this toughness alone does not make it wonderful. It is the really beautiful trails down, up and around Himmelbjerget. The views to Julsø (lake). The undulating terrain. The mixed style trails. 

During the 42K race, other runners from other distances are continuously let go too - into the same loop. This gives a refreshing race. And since it is a loop it is easy to get to exchange a few words / sentences with fellow runners. Ultimately creating an even better atmosphere. 

Additionally the race organization; it’s amazing. But then again, so are all of Eventyrsports events to be fair. They know what they do and their target audience. Well marked course, well placed aid stations and a fantastic start/finish area. Full of good vibes, music, laughter, victories, medals - it’s all there 🤗.

I will be back within the next few years - maybe even next year again 🤗.
