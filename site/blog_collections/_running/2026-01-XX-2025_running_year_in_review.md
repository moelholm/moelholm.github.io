This is a summary of how 2025 turned out to be for me in terms of running. I have kept it very short when it comes to mentioning the races etc., otherwise it would be a neverending story 😉.

# Training Volume
According to Strava, in 2025 I ran `4850K` over `464h20m` with a total elevation gain landing on `36.5K` (due to trail running and some longer mountain races). That's equivalent to an average of `93K` / `8.9h` per week.

That was similar to 2024, which shows a consistent high volume throughout the year. I managed to maintain a very solid training base while still pushing boundaries with some of the toughest races I've ever attempted.

# Races 

I had planned 14 races for 2025, and successfully completed all of them. No injuries or illness prevented me from starting - and no races resulted in a DNF. This consistency was something I was particularly proud of, especially given the challenging nature of many of the races.

The list contains 7 ultra races. Including several major challenges:

## Major "A Races"

### Mozart 100 by UTMB (June, Austria 🇦🇹)
My second jab at a 100K+ mountain ultra. With 120K and more than 5.3K elevation gain, this race in Salzburg was absolutely stunning. Running through the Austrian alps with challenging climbs up Zwölferhorn and Schafberg mountains was an incredible experience. The rain and darkness in the final kilometers made it extra challenging, but crossing that finish line after 18h47m was pure magic.

### Mors 100 Miles (September, Denmark 🇩🇰)
My second 100-miler! Unlike Kullamannen 2024 which was all about trails and mountains, Mors was a flat, super runnable road race around the beautiful island of Mors. The community support was unbelievable - every town welcomed us with cheers, music, and celebrations. 30 aid stations (!) made it very manageable. Despite some stomach issues, I finished in 18h11m, which was a great improvement in my 100-mile performance.

### Kullamannen by UTMB (November, Sweden 🇸🇪)
Back to Kullamannen for the second year in a row! This time I ran the full 100 miles (172.7K) and faced one of my toughest challenges yet. Starting in darkness at 18:00, I ran through 13 hours of night before seeing daylight. The Swedish autumn weather, technical trails, and strategic dropbag placement (only one, at 120K!) made this race exceptionally demanding. After 26h41m, I earned my second Kullamannen ring and 4 more UTMB running stones. My son Casper running the last meters with me to the finish line made it all worth it.

## Other Notable Races

The year kicked off strong with **LNBK Ringkøbing Fjord Winter Edition** (100K) in January, where I ran 10h18m on a flat, fast course - a great way to start the year.

I tried the **Wayout Backyard Ultra** again in April - one of my favorite race formats. Running 134K over 20 hours in that unique backyard ultra format never gets old. The social aspect and the mental challenge of "one more loop" is something special.

**Brooks Out 81** (81K) in August was a solid ultra distance that prepared me well for the 100-milers later in the season.

And I can't forget the shorter races that kept me sharp: **Odense City Half**, **Kolding Half**, and especially **Bestseller Aarhus City Half** where I ran 1h30m37s. Plus trail marathons and shorter trail races that kept the variety high.

# Total Race Statistics

Looking at my complete race calendar for 2025, here are the total stats from all 14 races:

- **Total Race Distance:** 856 kilometers
- **Total Race Elevation:** 16,316 meters  
- **Total Race Time:** 104 hours 51 minutes

That's an impressive amount of time spent racing! The breakdown shows how much ultra-distance racing dominated my year:

- **Ultra races (≥50km):** 7 races
- **Non-ultra races (<50km):** 7 races
- **Trail races:** 11 races
- **Road races:** 3 races

The three 100+ mile races (Mozart 100, Mors 100 Miles, and Kullamannen 100 Miles) alone accounted for over 450 kilometers and more than 60 hours of racing time.

# Personal Bests (PBs)

Before diving into PBs, the same disclaimer as last year applies: I'm still relatively new to serious running despite being 47 years old now 😰. This explains why I can still achieve PBs across various distances.

However, 2025 was different from 2024. While I didn't break as many pace-based PBs, I focused heavily on ultra-distance endurance and technical mountain running.

## Distance & Duration based PBs

My major achievements in 2025 were in the ultra-distance category:

- **100 Miles (second attempt):** `18h11m00s` (`06:49 /km`) - [Race: Mors 100 Miles](https://www.strava.com/activities/15724818429/overview) - A massive 5+ hour improvement over my first 100-miler!
- **100 Miles (third attempt):** `26h41m18s` (`09:15 /km`) - [Race: Kullamannen by UTMB 2025](https://www.strava.com/activities/16325029567/overview) - Much slower but on extremely technical terrain

## Elevation Gain based PBs

With [Race: Mozart 100 by UTMB](https://www.strava.com/activities/14727969242/overview) I matched the type of elevation gain I did at UTMB CCC in 2024: `5309m` over 120K. Running through the Austrian Alps with those massive climbs was both beautiful and brutal.

# Reflections on 2025

2025 was a year of consolidation and ultra-distance mastery. Rather than chasing speed PBs, I focused on building endurance and tackling longer, more technical races. The three 100-mile races taught me so much about:

- **Nutrition management** over extreme distances (especially after my stomach issues at Mors)
- **Mental resilience** through 26+ hours of running
- **Night running** and managing energy through darkness
- **Technical trail skills** on challenging mountain terrain
- **Self-sufficiency** with limited aid stations (Kullamannen's single dropbag at 120K!)

The consistent high training volume (averaging 93K per week) gave me the base to tackle these challenges. And completing all 14 planned races without a DNF was a huge achievement that I'm incredibly proud of.

# Looking Forward to 2026

While 2025 was about ultra-distance conquest, 2026 might see me backing off slightly on volume and focusing on speed again. But we'll see what adventures call out to me! 🏃‍♂️⛰️

The experiences from Mozart 100, Mors 100 Miles, and Kullamannen 100 Miles have shown me that I can handle the extreme distances. Now it's about refining the execution and maybe, just maybe, seeing what I can do when I combine all this endurance with some focused speed work.

But that's a story for next year... 😉
