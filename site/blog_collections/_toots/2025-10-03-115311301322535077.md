3 weeks with ✨Garmin Enduro 3✨

Battery 🪫 now low: dropped below 10% - said 3 days left (which would likely be the case if not used for activities). This is after 3 weeks. This last week here included another 9.5 hours GPS tracking.

I have now put it for charging 🔋… so that it is ready for the weekend’s runs.

This is the first time I’ve had to charge it since I got it. 🤠👌🏻👏🏻￼￼￼￼
