15K Afternoon Run 🏃🏽‍♀️ 

One of the usual runs. Yet slightly different due to fog all over 😲. These Wednesdays are tough: must leave work at precisely 15:00 hours to be ready to head out to the run. Then be in bath 🛁 and out at latest 17:10. Then drive directly to the swimming pool with Casper for his weekly training. My stress level is sky high up to the point where his training has started … and THEN I can start to relax a bit ￼🤣. Pheeeeew 😮‍💨
