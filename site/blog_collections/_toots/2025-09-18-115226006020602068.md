90 Minutes Elliptical 

Replaced today’s running with an elliptical session instead. Because after yesterday’s running I had a little setback on my right knee. So to avoid worsening that i resorted to the more gentle cardio activity here. It is as if time passes more slowly inside a gym than outside.
