Run | Rolling 400s | 8 x (400m + 400m)

A workout suggested by Runna. Trial period thing 👌🏻🤩. I configured it with the intention to direct training for Copenhagen Marathon. It is ofc borderline creative as I have a bunch of intermediate trail/ultra races that will mess up any good training plan.

It was a fun session. Run 400m at a fast pace then transition directly into another 400m at a slower but still fresh pace. No rest. Repeat 8 times.
