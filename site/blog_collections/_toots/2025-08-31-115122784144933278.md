I have such admiration for Courtney’s decision to keep on running to finish the UTMB. Despite the fact that the wheels fell off for her and she couldn’t claim the win like she is so used to. 

What a fantastic trait to just keep on - despite the headwind for her. This is the way to finish even for elites. Not always just DNF’ing when things don’t go by the plan - which seems to be the norm for them.

Respect 🫡💪🏼👏🏻🥳🥳🥳🥳
