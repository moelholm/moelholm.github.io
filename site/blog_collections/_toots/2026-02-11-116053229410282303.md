Intervals ￼

🔥10 x 400m, with 1 minute rest🔥

The last 3(-4) ones were challenging 😂. After the first 2 reps I concluded I had to drop pace a bit in order to make it to the 10th rep.

This workout was also (you guessed it?) planned by Runna as part of my marathon prep. I think it wonderfully puts me at my current limits.

Also shown; a screenshot from *the* Danish ultra runners podcast 👌🏻👌🏻🤩
