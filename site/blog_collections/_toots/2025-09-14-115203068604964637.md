✅ 11K Run

Second (and last) run for the week. The run went ok. Power is slowly returning (although very far from normal). Niggles around knees “moved around” >> excellent 😎￼ (better than one or more specific issue points). Was pretty exhausted afterwards which says a lot about my overall state (that I’m in full blown recovery ❤️‍🩹 mode still).
