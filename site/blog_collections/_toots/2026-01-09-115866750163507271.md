My biggest concern regarding tomorrows race (ultra) is getting there by car 🚘 safely and timely. There’s so much snow ❄️ on specifically the smaller roads that can be problematic- cars are reportedly getting stuck in snow here and there. 

It’s ~20:00 local time…. And soon bedtime 🛏️; up early to get to the race (in above conditions). It starts at 07:30, bibs can be collected from 06:30.

A good challenge awaits tomorrow - crazy windy and icy/snowy 😂 …it’s going to be very tough 😬
