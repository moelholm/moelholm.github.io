🏋🏻60 minutes weight training 

With my son 🤩. Full body. Second time. He is really listening to and learning from all my small corrections and tips 😎. Soon he will be able to recruit the (correct) muscle fibers for more power/strength. I am happy he has the patience to listen and learn. He wanted to go again tomorrow, but “rest day is where the muscles repair and grow”😇🙃
