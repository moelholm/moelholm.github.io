A few shots from my sons K9 biathlon yesterday with Nala. They took the short distance of 2.3K according to his Garmin watch and it took them just short of 20 minutes. Both were totally wet 💦 and dirty when arriving at the finishline 🤠￼🐶

It is WILD to experience the energy of dogs and dog lovers at these races. Even if you don’t have a dog I hope you one day get to see this first hand. So fun and energizing. 

I am a very proud dad - he and Nala were awesome 👏🏻☺️
