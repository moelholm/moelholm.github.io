Going to the gym today with my son 🏋🏻- he has been using the machines for strength training until now. But today we’re going to swap a few of them with free weights 💪🏼

It’s been far too long since I have trained with him. Months on end. But that’s how he prefers it; training alone. He has been super super consistent since he started; 3 times per week full body. Only disturbed 2-3 weeks due to illness. And IIRC only missing a single session ish. So very proud dad, here 🤩
