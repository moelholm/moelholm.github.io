At work today my colleague stumbled upon me being used as a model 🙃🤣 for a Danish backyard ultra race (see screenshot 😆).

Yes that’s most probably a “humble brag” 🤣 … quite funny I think. I don’t mind as it is a very nice race btw …. And I will run it next year again (already signed up).

It is one of the races I look the most forward to: the backyard format is so amazing 🤩
