🎬🍿I watched “Badwater 135” on Apple TV today

I have had the day off today so I spent it recovering ❤️‍🩹￼😂 by binge watching a lot of TV. Including this new documentary. Was fun to see Danish 🇩🇰 Stine Rex in there (Denmarks ultra queen) and other celebrities from the US 👌🏻

It seems insanely tough. That heat is wild. Cannot imagine what they are going through tbh. Respect to all starters of that race 🙇🏻‍♂️
