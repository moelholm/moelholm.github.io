🎄15K Monday run 

Christmas Eve in T-2 days 🤩. My biggest son was out away from the house this early morning today as we woke up … we didn’t know … turns out he was at the Gym 🏋🏻. That’s so cool - he has really embraced strength training 💪🏼. My wife says I have “brain washed our boys” 🤣 (little one was training in the living room recently 🤣). 

I love holidays … I get to sleep later and run without any of the usual daily stress to fit it in 😀
