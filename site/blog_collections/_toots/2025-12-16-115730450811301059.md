Yesterday I wrote to UTMB to look into an issue where the Brooks OUT race results weren’t assigned a UTMB score. 

I knew I did well in that race so I naturally was so egocentric to write to them about the “major issue” 😂 … and yepee: today they wrote to me that the results had been computed 👏🏻👌🏻

This 545 score is one of the best results I’ve had (if not the best) for the 50K category ￼🤠
