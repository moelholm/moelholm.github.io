6K Run 🏃🏻‍♂️ 

Tried my new Garmin Enduro 3 which I got today. My Forerunner 955 is ok still but it had 9% battery after Mors. That was the trigger! I want a watch with an abundance of battery for my longer ultras ￼🤠. 

Watch aside: knee caps still broken. The short run today even triggered a little left calf muscle strain (as in super mild… but there). So I’m for sure NOT recovered at all after the 100 miler 😂. Pretty rough recovery needs this time 😀…
