I have reached a stable green HRV 👌🏻. While having trained at a solid volume (3 weeks at 100K+) - much of that time has been on weekend long runs.

✨This has been really lucky 🍀 and nicely timed before Kullamannen by UTMB in ~< 2 weeks✨

I feel super strong endurance wise (diesel engine ready). No niggles at all (chassis ok). Fitness also seems to be getting better 👌🏻(not peaking at 110% … but enough for the race).

Will slowly start tapering somewhere around mid week 🤠👏🏻
