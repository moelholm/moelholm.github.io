15K Trail run 

Tried my brand new ✨ASICS Trabuco Max 4✨. In fact they were free because they are the result of my 10 years anniversary present - a gift card - I got from my dear colleagues a month back￼￼.

Shoes seems super great. But my legs are coping with my current training load - so they were really busted when I came home 🤭😂. For the trail run this weekend I will very likely use my old HOKA Speedgoats as they are proven 😇
