✅ 15K Morning run

It seems like an eternity since by now … but I was out early to run 🏃🏻‍♂️ 👌🏻⚡️. I had to, since my wife now is at a Christmas party with her company and thus I’m home alone with the kids 🤠 (hence I wouldn’t have an opportunity to run outside now).

I kind of - on the go - decided to gradually speed up progressively for the middle part, topping at 04:30 ish. Then I let the pace drop again. No master plan, just adapting out there 🤠
