🎅🏼15K Run

Listened to a Danish ultra running podcast where they in this episode was tasting beers … the interviewed folks are ultra runners and beer lovers. They sounded like they were having great fun for sure 🤣 🍻- I still need to listen to the last part … that will be quite entertaining too I’m sure 😆
