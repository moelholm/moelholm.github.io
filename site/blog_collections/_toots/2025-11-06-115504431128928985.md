Registered for the WSER 26 Lottery 😂

It will obviously NEVER happen with 1 ticket 🎟️… but I figured I could just as well start now. Then redo the process every year going forward. Then maybe one year I could have enough accumulated tickets to be lucky 🍀 enough 🙃. “Keep dreaming, Nicky”….

Used my Mozart 100 result which was within the time limit required by WSER 🤠
