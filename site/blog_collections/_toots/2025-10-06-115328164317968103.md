✅ 30 minutes weight lifting 🏋🏻 | Lower body

About time doing strength training again. Haven’t felt the energy for it during my illness + comeback window. There is no doubt that running takes priority for me. It helps then, when I have a “rest” day … like today … because that’s when I’m most prone to getting the strength training done.
