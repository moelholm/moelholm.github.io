I put my race ticket up for sale for Cold Hawaii Ultra 2025 - 50 miles ðŸ˜­

I am not fully recovered from Mors 100 Miles yet. And this 50 miler is already on Saturday. And with Kullamannen by UTMB in ~6 weeks I believe this choice is my best solution.

I hope to recover well and fully from Mors soon(ish) and *then* finish strong with a good block of specialized training for Kullamannen. 

(Mors was not planned originally so it conflicted with Cold here ðŸ˜…)
