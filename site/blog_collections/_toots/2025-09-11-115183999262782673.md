Post 100 Miler Update

So I ran that Mors 100 Miles race last Saturday (to mid Sunday night). Since then (*after* the race) I’ve been having sore knee caps (/top of knee area). So I cannot run still. It seems to decrease in intensity … but it is a slow process. Cross training until I can (let’s say dare to) run again. 

First time I’ve tried this consequence of an ultra. Suspect it was due to the extreme runnability of the course. So very high impact.
