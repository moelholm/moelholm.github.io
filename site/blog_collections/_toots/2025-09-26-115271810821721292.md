Two weeks with ✨Garmin Enduro 3✨

My watch is now at 40% battery 🔋. Since last week it has measured 5.5 hours of GPS activities. This is ofc super little - far below my usual activity level - but these are the stats. Impressive device 👌🏻

Fun fact: my Forerunner 955 has been lying unused since that day too. And it is keeping battery in the 30ies percent. But with zero use. It would of course have been fully drained already with normal use.
