14K Run

My Novablast shoes still feels like running on clouds. Super bouncy happy dolphin 🐬 foam 😂👍🏻. Particularly something I notice at the start of the run. Then my tired legs still tell me they are there. 

Deload week: I have a Runna prescribed Deload week now. It’s been a while since last time. I think my recovery processes will enjoy ￼👌🏻. I will still run a bit more than the marathon program says … but not much.
