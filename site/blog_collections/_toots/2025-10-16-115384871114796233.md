😒 It’s 18:45 CEST … sitting in the couch 🛋️ in my running clothes … waiting for my wife to get home from her Padel activity. I really prefer to run in the morning or straight after work…. 🙃

Just had dinner with my children … I was too hungry and energy drained to postpone that to after my evening run. 

So here goes a tired and fully stuffed Nicky for an evening activity 😂 

(this is for you Kullamannen 🇸🇪 ; I will bring my headlamp and a gel just to impress you 🤭🤠)
