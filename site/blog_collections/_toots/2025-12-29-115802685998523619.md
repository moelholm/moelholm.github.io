15K Morning run

Extremely heavy legs today. Definitely due to yesterdays pushing pace at distance. And possibly even also due to fatigue from my 10K PB attempt late last week. The pace today wasn’t even an issue to keep “low”… it came very naturally due to depletion. Battery 🪫 recharging slowly 🤭

Sleep + head is also not so normal ish. It is either the result of the training fatigue. Or it is adding to it. In any case: recovery ❤️‍🩹 - perhaps a nice cake 🧁 🤤🤤
