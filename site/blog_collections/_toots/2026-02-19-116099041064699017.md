Tempo | On Off Ks 🏃🏻‍♂️💨

A Runna workout: 4 x (1K fast, 1K faster). No rest in between. So 8K at good effort. Lovely session again. ℹ️Pro tip: I have now enabled a Runna setting where “warm up” on Garmin workouts are until I push the lap button on my watch. This gives some good peace of mind while attempting to get to the point where the workout should ideally start. Before I had to wait with starting my workout session to make it work for me.
