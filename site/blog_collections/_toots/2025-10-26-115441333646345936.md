✨NEWS✨: Just added 3 new races to 2026

A 100K road run in Jan.  
A 46K trail run in Feb.  
And a 24H (hours) run in May.

The last one will be the first time - in 2024 I ran the 12H variant. But the format is so amazing that I want to go again.

The 100K race will be my second time at that. I’ve run the 50K before too. It’s a tough race due to strong head wind up the west coast.

The 46K race: a longer version of the race that I’ve run twice before at 28K. New opportunity- yes thanks 🙏🏻
