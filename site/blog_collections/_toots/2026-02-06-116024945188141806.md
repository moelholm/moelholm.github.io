Progressive Tempo Run

Today was my tempo run day. Another great Runna session: 4 x 2K at progressively faster paces. 

The last kilometer was challenging. I did also stay at the ambitious end of my pace targets throughout …so perhaps that’s part of it (producing more lactate than I could have gotten away with). 

I had a 3K easy run up to the start of the session. So a total of 15K today.
