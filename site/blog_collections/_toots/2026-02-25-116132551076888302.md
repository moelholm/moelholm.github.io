🚀 Run | Intervals | 5 x 1 mile with 2 min rest

Another Runna workout. Intervals - 5 of them. Felt good - but I had to work for it. Ended on 16K plus today. I really like having this variety of the runs … my “short” easy runs sometimes feel tougher (mentally primarily… but sometimes physically too, heavy legs, due to recovering from previous harder days).

My impression of Runna is great. For a race program. Haven’t tried other training features yet though.
