￼Integrated Strava to my web site

Now it shows my latest 10 activities (excluding walking). It also shows the 2 latest activities on the landing page (but in a compact visual form instead). 

Handling the refresh token was a bit tricky. I ended up maintaining it in a dedicated AWS SSM Parameter Store entry. Integrates nicely with GHA using OIDC trust (so no long lived IAM creds). Since I develop from a CodeSpace I also finally got a seamless AWS SSO setup as a side effect👌🏻😎👏🏻
