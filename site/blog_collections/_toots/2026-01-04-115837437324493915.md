Run | 3 x 3K faster and 1K recovery ❤️‍🩹 

Sunday run done ✅- what a great day out. Lovely lovely weather. No wind. Ran 1K with my wife’s brother’s son as I met him out there 👏🏻🤗 (he was at pace 4:xx 🥵 … so it took intention to catch up with him and tag along for a while 😀). 

Main session: 3 x 3K fast. With 1K jogging in between. Felt great and like work (intention was required 😅).
