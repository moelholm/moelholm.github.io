✅ 90 minutes run ❄️ 

Tried my ice spikes for the first time. Well actually some really cheap (crappy?) ones that my wife bought and that I immediately assumed ownership over as I could see their use for running days like today 🤭🤭🤭🤭

Conclusion: it is weird running on spikes. But I had zero slide experiences - I believe they did their job well. I will take them with me for all icy runs like this
