I have to brag about this (skip if you dislike ego crap like this 😂): The Fussingø trail race I ran a month back has got the highest UTMB Index score to date for me: 574 🤯😎👌🏻. 

And also that means my general index is now on 557 🤠.

But aehm … I cannot see how I can ever hold these (for me) fine values. But yeah that December race went really really well ￼🤗
