🎥🍿Mr Ultra from Sweden 🇸🇪- Marcus Kjellberg - has just released his Kullamannen by UTMB race video. It is super well filmed and gives a very good feel of the circumstances that he (and I) ran in for the 100 miler.

Additionally - I am proud to say that I am part of his video at around ~09:30-09:45 ish where I very AWKWARDLY say “Hi Marcus hehe” 🙈🙈🙈 …well I was just star struck 🤣🤣

His performance humbles me💪🏼
