In this post I show how you can implementÂ Gherkin tests for Spring Boot 1.4.1. Here is an example of a Gherkin based test script:

<img src="/img/2016-10-15-gherkin-tests.png" class="w-100 pl-2 pr-2" />

TheÂ `Feature`,Â `Scenario`,Â `Scenario Outline`,Â `Given`, `When`, `Then` and `And` constructs are part of the Gherkin test language [1]. Such tests are popular in Behavior-driven development (BDD) and is meant as a common tool between users from the business and users from the development team [2].
<blockquote class="blockquote">The idea is that you can execute such a Gherkin script and get a test result (did it work or not?)</blockquote>
NoticeÂ the Gherkin language, there is nothing that prevents you from writing such tests even before the real business code exists. In fact it is aÂ BDD best practice to write the testsÂ `before` the feature gets implemented:
<blockquote class="blockquote">Imagine if you and the business wrote Gherkin tests as part of a User Story's acceptance criteria...</blockquote>
I haven't done this yet. But I bet there are a lot of BDD practitioners that have.

### About the Spring Boot 1.4 example
I have prepared a Spring Boot 1.4.1 based example [on GitHub](https://github.com/nickymoelholm/smallexamples/tree/master/hello-springboot-cucumber/). Consult that to see the code in its entirety and true surroundings.Â The example consists of:

- The Gherkin test script you saw at the beginning of this post: It's a script that tests aÂ "greetings" RESTful(<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ish</span>) resource.
- The greetings resource: AÂ super simpleÂ Spring MVC `@RestController`Â that accepts a caller name as input and emits a greeting message as output. This is the resource being tested.

I have used a 5 step recipe for making this work....

### Step 1 of 5: Configure the build script
The example uses Gradle as it's build technology. The Gherkin test support comes via theÂ Cucumber-JVM test framework [3]Â and the Gradle Cucumber Plugin [4]. Here's the Gradle script:

```grovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        // So that the Gradle Cucumber Plugin can be downloaded:
        maven { url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/" }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:1.4.1.RELEASE")
        classpath("com.github.samueltbrown:gradle-cucumber-plugin:0.9")
    }
}

apply plugin: 'java'
apply plugin: 'spring-boot'
// So that the Gradle Cucumber Plugin gets activated:
apply plugin: 'com.github.samueltbrown.cucumber'

sourceCompatibility = 1.8
targetCompatibility = 1.8

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
    testCompile 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test'
    // So that you can use the cucumber API's for your step implementations:
    cucumberCompile 'info.cukes:cucumber-java:1.2.5'
    cucumberCompile 'info.cukes:cucumber-junit:1.2.5'
    cucumberCompile 'info.cukes:cucumber-spring:1.2.5'
}

cucumber {
    // So that you can generate some pretty (...) reports:
    formats = ['pretty', 'json:build/cucumber/cucumber.json', 'junit:build/cucumber/cucumber.xml', 'html:build/cucumber/html']

    // So that you can run all features/scenarios except for those annotated with @Ignore:
    tags = ['~@Ignore']
}
```

Notice the comments in the buildscript. They highlight what parts of the Gradle script are particularly interesting.

By using the Gradle Cucumber Plugin you now have the support for a new source folder structure:

```code
src/cucumber
|--- java
|--- resources
```

You put the Gherkin step implementations in the `src/cucumber/java` directory and the Gherkin scripts under the `src/cucumber/resources` directory.

### Step 2 of 5: Write the Gherkin tests
The Gherkin tests are written in a `.feature` file. In the example I put the following contents into `src/cucumber/resources/greetingsResource.feature`:

<img src="/img/2016-10-15-gherkin-tests-2.png" class="w-100 pl-2 pr-2" />

This script contains 3 test scenarios.

The two first tests are based on the `Scenario Outline` and uses data from the `Examples` block. First column is the input we send to the `greetings` resource. Second and third columns are the expected outputs given that input. So: If we send in `Duke` to the `greetings` resource then we expect an HTTP status code `200` and a body with the message `Hello World, Duke`.

The third test is a `Scenario` that is not based on example input data. This test is just for fun ðŸ˜‰ [5].

In the real world you would cover error conditions as well. So if you are testing a RESTful resource, like in this example, you would test for client errors 4xx etc.

### Step 3 of 5: Implement the Gherkin steps test code
Here's the step implementations for the Gherkin script:

```java
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@ContextConfiguration // Don't ask
public class GreetingsResourceSteps {

  @Autowired
  private TestRestTemplate restTemplate;

  private String caller; // input

  private ResponseEntity<String> response; // output

  @Given("I use the caller (.*)")
  public void useCaller(String caller) {
    this.caller = caller;
  }

  @When("I request a greeting")
  public void requestGreeting() {
    response = restTemplate
        .exchange("/greetings/{caller}", HttpMethod.GET, null, String.class, caller);
  }

  @Then("I should get a response with HTTP status code (.*)")
  public void shouldGetResponseWithHttpStatusCode(int statusCode) {
    assertThat(response.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(statusCode);
  }

  @And("The response should contain the message (.*)")
  public void theResponseShouldContainTheMessage(String message) {
    assertThat(response.getBody()).isEqualTo(message);
  }

}
```

Take a look at the class definition: this is where we tell the cucumber test framework to kickstart the Spring container. In fact it's just like you would do in a typical Spring Boot 1.4 integration test: using the `@SpringBootTest` annotation. Said in another way: The Spring `ApplicationContext` will be launched prior to executing the Gherkin test scenarios.

Now take a look at lines 5+6: Here we inject Springs `TestRestTemplate`. We use this to send HTTP requests for our RESTful resource. Again, this is just like you would do in a typical Spring Boot 1.4 integration test.

Now take a look at the `@Given`, `@When`, `@Then`, and `@And` annotations: These define the methods implementing the steps. You can track them right back to the `src/cucumber/resources/greetingsResource.feature` file. Notice how we use simple regular expressions to map step input (fx `caller` values) to method parameters.

In case of errors, the steps throws ordinary `java.lang.AssertionError`s via the awesome AssertJ library [6].

See? It `almost` looks like a normal Spring Boot integration test. One major difference is the need for storing intermediate state in the class itself (or somewhere else: fx a shared class). Well rest in the knowledge that any involved step classes, here `GreetingsResourceSteps`, are disposed after each Scenario. Said in another way: you have a fresh "steps" instance for each scenario.

You may also want to take a look at the `@Before` and `@After` cucumber annotations. They resemble the same from JUnit.

### Step 4Â of 5: Implement the feature being tested
Lastly, we get to the actual feature. It's just the ordinary `@RestController`:

```java
@RestController
public class GreetingsController {

  @GetMapping("/greetings/{caller}")
  public ResponseEntity<?> getGreeting(@PathVariable String caller) {

    if ("0xCAFEBABE".equalsIgnoreCase(caller)) {
      return new ResponseEntity<>(HttpStatus.I_AM_A_TEAPOT);
    }

    String greeting = String.format("Hello World, %s", caller);

    return new ResponseEntity<>(greeting, HttpStatus.OK);
  }

}
```

Ahem ... I obviously wrote this controller after the Gherkin tests.

### Step 5Â of 5: Run the Gherkin tests and get the result
Thanks to the Gradle Cucumber Plugin, running the tests is a matter of:

```code
./gradlew clean cucumber
```

Here is an example output:

<img src="/img/2016-10-15-gherkin-tests-3.png" class="w-100 pl-2 pr-2" />

And here is an example output from the HTML generated report at `./build/cucumber/html/index.html`:

<img src="/img/2016-10-15-gherkin-tests-4.png" class="w-100 pl-2 pr-2" />

Using Jenkins as a CI server? You can find a bunch of cucumber plugins for that. Just point the plugins to your `build/cucumber` directory and you are good to go.

### In retrospective
This example was all about testing a RESTful resource. But Gherkin style tests are not limited to that:
The Gherkin step implemention code could test anything. You could drive Selenium tests if you want to. Or Spring `@Service` beans. You decide.

The important thing is that it helps you and the business drive the right solution.
