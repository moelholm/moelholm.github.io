I am really happy withÂ theÂ `actuator` functionality in Spring Boot applications.Â It offers some fantastic tools for gaining insight into your application. Some of the REST endpoints that you getÂ - such asÂ `health` andÂ `metrics` - are easy to read. Despite the fact thatÂ they render as JSON, my guess is that your human eyes still can comprehend it.
<blockquote>But have you ever taken a look at the output from Spring Boot's dump endpoint?</blockquote>
That's really not so friendly to read. At least not for my kind of eyes. And perhaps thatsÂ okay - if you got some tooling that can parse the thread stack info and show it nicely to you. But chances are that you don't have that - like I didn't.

So, a while back, Â I decided to create a Spring Boot plugin that you just include on theÂ application classpath. Like you do with the Spring Boot starters. This is what you get:

<img src="/img/2016-08-12-dump-ui.png" class="w-100 pl-2 pr-2" />

Red lines indicate methods that owns an intrinsic lock (thinkÂ `synchronized` in Java land). I added a little gray line above each such event:Â itÂ tells you what kind of class the intrinsic lock is associated with.

I haveÂ added this plugin to theÂ Maven Central. Find it <a href="http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.moelholm.tools/actuator-ui-dump" target="_blank">here</a>.

The code is OSSÂ - find it at <a href="https://github.com/nickymoelholm/tools/tree/master/actuator-ui-dump" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. It is also here that you will find some extra documentation onÂ how you can configure the plugin - so check it out if you want to give it a spin.

By the way: It was very interestingÂ to make such a Spring Boot plugin. It usesÂ auto configuration and other cool stuff. If you think that sounds interesting, then look at the code: it is really simple ğŸ˜‰.
