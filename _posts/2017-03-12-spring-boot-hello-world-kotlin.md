In this post I show how you can create a Spring Boot 1.5 application using Kotlin 1.1 (as opposed to typically Java 8 in these times).

The example I've created is a typical "Hello World" example. I have chosen to implement a Spring MVC controller - and an awesome Spring Boot integration test. The Gradle build script uses Kotlin as well (that's pretty awesome). You can find the example project in its entirety and real contextÂ <a href="https://github.com/nickymoelholm/smallexamples/tree/master/springboot-kotlin-helloworld" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>.

In this post I also explainÂ some of the Kotlin specificsÂ worthÂ noticing to a typical (Spring) Java developer.Â If you are a Kotlin savvy developer and find that my explanations are wrong or misleadingÂ - then please leave a comment, so that I can fix them. I am by no means a Kotlin specialist (yet!).

Just want to see the code?

### 1 of 4: The Spring Boot application

```kotlin
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication

@SpringBootApplication
class Application

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    SpringApplication.run(Application::class.java, *args)
}
```

Notice that we activate Spring Boot using the normal `@SpringBootApplication` annotation. The fun part here, if you will, is that in Kotlin classes doesn't even need to have a body. I guess many of them will have one - but here it is simply not necessary.

The `main` method in Kotlin is a package level function (it is not embedded inside a class).

We pass `Application::class<strong>.java</strong>` to theÂ `run` method. That is not a typoÂ - and itÂ is not aÂ Java source file reference ðŸ™‚.Â It is still theÂ `Class` object that represents class `Application.Â `If you just pass `Application::class` - then you would pass an object of typeÂ `KClass`Â - that is Kotlins own representation of what you know as the `Class` type from Java!

The weird `*args` is not a pointer - but rather KotlinsÂ `spread` operator (theÂ `run` method declaresÂ a vararg parameter).

( Also: Semicolons are not used - no biggie for me though )

### 2 of 4: The controller

```kotlin
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController

@RestController
class GreetingController {

 @GetMapping("/hello/{name}")
 fun get(@PathVariable name: String) = "Hello, $name"

}
```

This is a typical Spring MVC controller. I betÂ you can recognise `@RestController, @GetMapping`Â and `@PathVariableÂ `(if you are an experiencedÂ Spring Java developer).

Notice that the functionÂ is prefixed withÂ `fun` here. It looks like a variable assignment, but it isn't. What you see there is an implicit `return` statement of the string `"Hello, $name".` The function could have had a body and aÂ `return` statement instead - but it isn't necessary in this case.

Notice that the the function doesn't have an explicit return type. You could have put "`: String`" just before the equals sign. But KotlinÂ can infer it - so not necessary in this case either.

The `$name` argument is replaced with the contents of the `name` parameter - a demonstration of Kotlins support for `string interpolation`. This, almostÂ insignificant feature, would have a huge effect on many of the Java projects I have seen!

### 3 of 4: The integration test

```kotlin
import org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat
import org.junit.Test
import org.junit.runner.RunWith
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest
import org.springframework.boot.test.web.client.TestRestTemplate
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner

@RunWith(SpringRunner::class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
class GreetingControllerIntegrationTests {

    @Autowired
    lateinit var restTemplate: TestRestTemplate

    @Test
    fun `GET when given Duke then returns "Hello, Duke"`() {

        // Given
        val name = "Duke"

        // When
        val body = restTemplate.getForObject("/hello/{name}", String::class.java, name)

        // Then
        assertThat(body).isEqualTo("Hello, $name")

    }

}
```

Worth noticing here is the weirdÂ `lateinit` modifier [lateinit]. So this is the deal:Â Kotlin normally assume that the memberÂ is non-null and therefore it must be assigned explicitly in the constructor to a non-null value. But since the Spring TestContext Framework takes care of the injection after the constructor has run, then we need to allow it explicitly, using the `lateinit` modifier.

Another interesting element is the `@Test` function name: I actually started with the name `get_whenInvokedWithDuke_thenReturnsHelloDuke`. But I updated the example after a recommendation from Tyler (see the comments below): Using backticks around function names allow us to provide sentence-like function names. Super nice for naming tests if you ask me.

In the @Test itself: notice the use ofÂ `val`. It's like Java's `final`Â modifier (in context of variables). Kotlin's type inference means that we aren'tÂ forced to write down the type (`String`).

So.... I think this seems super nice. The code is not overly verbose with type information. And at least for this Hello World case I think it is perfectly fine. I'm also pretty happy with the string interpolation again ðŸ™‚ ... (in Java land I tend to use `String.format("stuff...%s", varhere)` - rather annoying).

### 4 of 4: The Gradle script
I have been using Gradle as a drop-in replacement for Maven for the last 1.5 year. For that periodÂ I've always used Groovy as the programming language in my Gradle scripts. And I kind of like that - but also, I must admit that the IDE assistance isn't super optimalÂ (even in IntelliJ which I use now).

Then as I wasÂ browsing Kotlin features etc, I found out that the Gradle guys are working on supporting Kotlin as another programming language in scripts [gradlekotlin]. And not only that: they are working on making Kotlin the language of choice for developing Gradle plugins [gradlescriptkotlin] !

Okay - the code:

```kotlin
buildscript {

    val springBootVersion = "1.5.2.RELEASE"
    var kotlinVersion: String by extra
    kotlinVersion = "1.1.0"

    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:$springBootVersion")
        classpath("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlinVersion")
        classpath("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-allopen:$kotlinVersion")
    }

}

val kotlinVersion: String by extra

apply {
    plugin("kotlin")
    plugin("kotlin-spring")
    plugin("org.springframework.boot")
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    compile("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:$kotlinVersion")
    compile("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-reflect:$kotlinVersion")
    compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web")
    testCompile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test")
}
```

Looks like the ordinary Groovy based script in my opinion. That's nice - so no big re-adjustment.

I am quite certain that youÂ should use an up-to-date version of IntelliJ to get a decent IDE experience with Kotlin based build scripts. For me it seems okay (IntelliJ IDEA 2016.3.5) - but the content assist isÂ extremely slow. I guess that will be nailed properly at some point. Also I still think I get a bunch of weird suggestions in my content assist in the different blocks.

### Motivation: why Kotlin?
I love Java for it's simplicity - and I know it by heart.

But, to be honest I feel there are a bunch of nice features in most of the other popular languages today that Java simply doesn't have. Kotlin is one of these new JVM languages - and it has a truly remarkable feature list. Head over to the reference manual and browse through it [kotlinreference]; I promise that you will be clapping your hands as you read through the individual features.

Lately I've noticed how Pivotal embraces Kotlin - through examples,Â public demo sessions (fx byÂ our favorite rockstar, Starbuxman [starbuxman]) and nonetheless by making the core Spring Framework seamless to use from Kotlin [springkotlin]. Being an avid Spring Boot fan that got my attention.

I haven't tried Kotlin on a real world project yet. But I definitely hope that I will get the chance very soon.
